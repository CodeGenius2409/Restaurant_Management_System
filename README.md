# Restaurant_Management_System
This C program simulates a fast food restaurant ordering system. It allows users to view the menu, order items, and calculate the total bill with discounts and GST applied. The program uses a `struct` to store all variables, including item prices, quantities, and totals. It handles ordering for 10 menu items and computes the discount based on the total amount (ranging from 2% to 8%). The user can order multiple items, and once done, the final bill is displayed with the total amount, discount, GST, and net payable amount. The system runs until the user chooses to exit.
