# Restaurant_Management_System
This C program simulates a fast food ordering system. Users can view a menu, place orders, and calculate the bill with discounts and GST. It supports ordering from 10 items, computes a discount based on the total, and applies 5% GST. Multiple items can be added, and the final bill shows the net amount. The program runs until the user exits.
